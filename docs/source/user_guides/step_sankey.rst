Loading data
------------

Throughout this guide we use our demonstration :doc:`simple_shop </datasets/simple_shop>` dataset. It has already been converted to :doc:`Eventstream<eventstream>` and assigned to ``stream`` variable. If you want to use your own dataset, upload it following :ref:`this instruction<eventstream_creation>`.

.. code-block:: python

    from retentioneering import datasets

    stream = datasets.load_simple_shop()

Basic example
-------------

The step Sankey diagram represents eventstream as a stepwise directed graph. The nodes are associated with events that appear at a particular step in a user's trajectory. The nodes are sorted from left to right according to the ordinal number of step (1, 2, etc). The edges visualize how often transition from, say, event ``A`` happened at ``i``-th step to event ``B`` happened at ``i+1``-th step occurred. The nodes and edges sizes reflect the number of unique users involved.

The step Sankey diagram in some sense is an extension of the :doc:`step matrix</user_guides/step_matrix>` diagram. The latter shows the distribution of the events with respect to an ordinal step, but in addition the step Sankey chart reflects connections between adjacent steps which the step matrix lacks of. Hence, step Sankey inherits many features that step matrix have, so we recommend you to read :doc:`Step matrix user guide</user_guides/step_matrix>` before you read this document.

The implementation is based on the `Plotly Sankey diagram <https://plotly.com/python/sankey-diagram/>`_ and inherits all the benefits from its parent. In particular, the diagram is interactive, so you can hover the nodes and edges and look at the detailed info, move the nodes, and even merge them (to merge use *Box Select* or *Lasso Select* tools located at the top-right corner on hover).

The primary way to build a step Sankey diagram graph is to call :py:meth:`Eventstream.step_sankey()<retentioneering.eventstream.eventstream.Eventstream.step_sankey>` method. Here is how it visualizes ``simple_shop`` eventstream:

.. code-block:: python

    stream.step_sankey(max_steps=5)

.. raw:: html

    <div style="overflow:auto;">
    <iframe
        width="1200"
        height="500"
        src="../_static/user_guides/step_sankey/basic_step_sankey.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>

Here we can see user flow. The nodes are grouped into columns in stepwise manner. The first column corresponds to the events that occurred at the users' first step, the second column corresponds to the second step and so on. The height of a rectangle representing a node is proportional to the frequency this particular event occurred at this particular step. From this diagram we can see (if we hover the mouse cursor on the node) that at the first step the ``catalog`` event appeared 2.69K times (71.61% of the users) whereas the ``main`` event appeared 1.07K times (28.39% of the users). That is why the red rectangular (for the ``catalog`` event) is ~2.5 times higher than the green rectangular (for the ``main`` event). The percentage of the users is calculated with respect to all the users participating in the parent eventstream.

An edge's width is proportional to the frequency of this transition in the eventstream. Hovering the mouse on the edges, you can reveal not only these frequencies, but also the info on how long a transition took the users on average. For example, we can see that the transition ``catalog (1st step) -> catalog (2nd step)`` appeared in 869 paths, and it took 29 seconds on average.

    +---------------+---------------+--------------+

Finally, we mention that ``max_steps`` arguments we used above denotes the number of the steps to be displayed in the diagram (starting from the 1st step).

.. note::

    The charts in this user guide are usually quite wide, so do not forget to use horizontal scroll bar to see the entire visualization.

Terminating event
-----------------

Similar to step matrix, step Sankey diagram uses the idea of synthetic ``ENDED`` event. This event is padded in the end of short paths (meaning that their length is less than ``max_steps``) so that their length becomes exactly ``max_path``. See :ref:`Step matrix user guide <transition_matrix_terminating_event>` for the details.

Having ``ENDED`` event implemented guarantees that the sum of the user shares over each column (i.e. each step) is exactly 1. ``ENDED`` is always placed at the bottom of the diagram. The following example demonstrates this (we temporarily set ``threshold=0`` for the comparison purposes, see the next section).

.. code-block:: python

    stream.step_sankey(max_steps=5, threshold=0)

.. raw:: html

    <div style="overflow:auto;">
    <iframe
        width="1300"
        height="500"
        src="../_static/user_guides/step_sankey/path_end.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>

In this diagram we see that ``ENDED`` appears at the 2nd step and involves 443 users. At the 3rd step ``ENDED`` event contains 823 users, and for 443 of them the event have been propagated from the previous step.

Collapsing rare events
----------------------

As in the case of the :ref:`step matrix<transition_matrix_collapsing_events>`, it is reasonable to collapse rare events in the step Sankey diagram since these events make the diagram excessively noisy. This behaviour is controlled by the ``threshold`` argument. An event is considered as rare if its maximum frequency over all the steps represented in the diagram is less than ``threshold``. The threshold might be of whether ``int`` or ``float`` type. The former stands for the limit for the absolute number of the users, the latter stands for the percentage of the users. All these rare events are not removed from the diagram, but collapsed to the ``thresholded_N`` artificial event instead, where ``N`` stands for the number of the collapsed events. The ``thresholded_N`` event appears in the step Sankey diagram only and is not added to the parent eventstream.

The default value for ``threshold`` is 0.05. Let us look how the events are collapsed if we set ``threshold=0.1`` and compare the result with the previous diagram (with ``threshold=0`` parameter).

.. code-block:: python

    stream.step_sankey(max_steps=5, threshold=0.1)

.. raw:: html

    <div style="overflow:auto;">
    <iframe
        width="1100"
        height="500"
        src="../_static/user_guides/step_sankey/thresh_0.1.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>

We see that ``thresholded_5`` event has appeared. As you might have noticed, it contains ``product1``, ``payment_choice``, ``delivery_choice``, ``delivery_courier``, and ``delivery_pickup``. Let us explain why, for example, the ``product1`` event has been collapsed. Look at the first chart with ``threshold=0``. The ``product1`` event contains 7.01%, 4.51, 4.27, and 3.2% of the users at steps 2, 3, 4, 5 correspondingly. Since the maximum value (7.01%) is less than ``threshold=0.1``, the event has been collapsed.

Please also note that the number ``_5`` in the ``thresholded_5`` event name carries no information about a specific step. For example, from the chart with ``threshold=0`` we see that at step 2 only one event among these 5 is represented (``product1``), so it is the only event which is collapsed at this step. On the other hand, at step 3 ``product1`` and ``delivery_choice`` appear, so they are collapsed to ``thresholded_5`` event. Finally, at step 5 all these 5 events are collapsed.

If you want to prevent some events from collapsing, use the ``targets`` parameter then. We evolve the previous example, but now we are aiming to drag ``product1`` and ``delivery_choice`` events out from the ``thresholded_5`` event, so we put them into the ``targets`` list.

.. code-block:: python

    stream\
        .step_sankey(
            max_steps=5,
            threshold=0.1,
            targets=['product1', 'delivery_choice']
        )

.. raw:: html

    <div style="overflow:auto;">
    <iframe
        width="1200"
        height="500"
        src="../_static/user_guides/step_sankey/thresh_and_target.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>

Look at step 2. What we see is that ``thresholded_5`` event has disappeared completely, and ``product1`` has been revealed instead. At step 3 there is no ``thresholded_5`` event too. It has been replaced by ``product1`` and ``delivery_choice``. Finally, at step 4 we see a couple of target events ``product1`` and ``delivery_choice``, but ``thresholded_3`` event is also represented here. It still contains 3 events: ``delivery_courier``, ``delivery_pickup``, and ``payment_choice``.

Events sorting
--------------

Intuitively, the events order within a column depends on the corresponding user shares at a particular step. It is true in many cases, but this is not the only logic considered. The sorting algorithm also takes into account when (at which step) an event appears in the diagram for the first time. The algorithm ranks higher the events which appear earlier even if their frequency is low at a particular step.

To illustrate this logic consider a dummy eventstream:

.. code-block:: python

    from retentioneering.eventstream import Eventstream

    dummy_stream = Eventstream(
        pd.DataFrame(
            [
                [1, 'event1', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
                [1, 'event1', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
                [2, 'event1', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
                [2, 'event2', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
                [3, 'event1', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
                [3, 'event2', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
                [4, 'event1', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
                [4, 'event2', '2023-01-01 00:00:00'],
            ],
            columns=['user_id', 'event', 'timestamp']
        )
    )
    dummy_stream.step_sankey(max_steps=4)

.. raw:: html

    <div style="overflow:auto;">
    <iframe
        width="700"
        height="300"
        src="../_static/user_guides/step_sankey/dummy_sorting.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>

From this chart we see that there is no ``event2`` spotted at step 1. However, at step 2, despite the dominance of ``event2`` (75% of the users at step 2 had ``event2``), ``event1`` is placed higher since it is considered "older" than ``event2``.

Using a separate instance
-------------------------

By design, :py:meth:`Eventstream.step_sankey()<retentioneering.eventstream.eventstream.Eventstream.step_sankey>` is a shortcut method that uses :py:meth:`StepSankey<retentioneering.tooling.step_sankey.step_sankey.StepSankey>` class under the hood. This method creates an instance of StepSankey class and embeds it into the eventstream object. Eventually, ``Eventstream.step_sankey()`` returns exactly this instance.

Sometimes it is reasonable to work with a separate instance of StepSankey class. An alternative way to get the same visualization that ``Eventstream.step_sankey()`` produces is to call :py:meth:`StepSankey.fit()<retentioneering.tooling.step_sankey.step_sankey.StepSankey.fit>` and :py:meth:`StepSankey.plot()<retentioneering.tooling.step_sankey.step_sankey.StepSankey.plot>` methods explicitly. The former method calculates all the values needed for the visualization, the latter displays these values as a Sankey diagram.

.. code-block:: python

    from retentioneering.tooling.step_sankey import StepSankey

    step_sankey = StepSankey(stream)
    step_sankey.fit(max_steps=5, threshold=0.1)
    step_sankey.plot()

    </div>

Common tooling properties
-------------------------

values
~~~~~~

Since the StepSankey object is essentially a graph, it is natural to get the underlying values as the data on the graph's nodes and edges. So :py:meth:`StepSankey.values<retentioneering.tooling.step_sankey.step_sankey.StepSankey.values>` property returns two pandas.DataFrame objects. The first relates to the nodes, the second relates to the edges. ``show_plot=False`` in the examples below is needed to suppress displaying the diagram.

.. code-block:: python

    # StepSankey graph nodes
    stream\
        .step_sankey(show_plot=False)\
        .values[0]
